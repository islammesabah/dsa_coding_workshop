# Coding Workshop Task: Build a Personal Website

## Overview

We will use the Cursor IDE integrated with a free LLM to generate a personal website. The design will be inspired by Andrew Ng's personal website: [https://www.andrewng.org/](https://www.andrewng.org/).

The website will be created for a Computer Science student at RPTU named **Harry Potter.**

## Website Features

The website must include the following sections:

- **About Section**: Include text describing the student and their studies.
- **Courses Section**: List the courses attended by the student.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase projects implemented by the student, with mock links to GitHub repositories.
- **Custom Section**: Add your own additional section(s) as desired.

Additional requirements:

- **Theme Switcher**: Implement a toggle to switch between dark and light modes, with black (dark) as the default.
- **Social Media Links**: Include links and emojis for the student's social media platforms.

## Instructor Guidelines

As the instructor, you will:

1. Set up the IDE and guide students through navigating it and connecting to the LLM.
2. Build the first section (About) together with the students.
3. Demonstrate how students can open the website on localhost.
4. At the end, show how students can use agent mode to generate a README file for the project.
