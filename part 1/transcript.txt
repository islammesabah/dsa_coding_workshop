[00:00] that little company known as Anthropic of course Claude Code their famous tool behind it has caused quite the ruckus
[00:07] okay we're we're talking about people are very very upset okay I I I swear I could still hear Twitter
[00:13] people just screaming right now and it's been days and if you have no idea what I'm talking about honestly
[00:19] you're living a blessed life okay I want you just to look out on that farm and I just want
[00:24] you to smile because you you have it peaceful you have a nice time but the rest of us have
[00:29] to live with what happens out here in the real world okay punk you don't know what I have to
[00:33] see but since you're watching this video you will now discover everything okay we're going to go over everything uh
[00:38] there's a lot of people yapping about what's going on with Anthropic uh I'm going to give you hopefully what
[00:43] is the full story but more I'm going to also just I I'm going to make a couple you know
[00:47] I might project a little bit i might make some guesses myself at the end okay for those that are
[00:51] in the know you've probably seen the image for those that aren't you have not seen this image but effectively
[00:56] it says this credential is only authorized for the use with clawed code and cannot be used for other API
[01:02] requests this is the big image that kind of kicked off this whole anthropic hate that's going on right now
[01:08] so what exactly is happening here well if you don't know Anthropic does have plans you can get a pro
[01:13] plan a pro 5x plan and a pro 20x plan and if you're on that plan you at least up
[01:19] until now could use that token and say cursor you could use it inside of Open Code and be able
[01:25] to use your plan and use your set amount or limited tokens to be able to do a bunch of
[01:29] code changes well that all changed this week they said "Hey guess what absolutely not nobody else is doing that
[01:37] you can only use the plan and claude code." Now this came as a big surprise for everybody okay people
[01:42] were not happy the GitHubs are just as you can see just filled with just people trying to find workarounds
[01:47] with it tons of comments ridiculous amounts of comments going on in there people saying they're cancelling just a lot
[01:53] of stuff lot of people not happy so in other words if you pay for a subscription plan you cannot
[02:00] use thirdparty tools you must use cloud code if you pay by the API pricing which is literally like something
[02:06] like 10x more expensive then you can use things that are non cloud code you can use open code you
[02:12] can use cursor you can use whatever but there's a lot more to it I think this Reddit post right
[02:17] here is honestly really illuminating uh they're effectively saying that everybody's is kind of lying about the situation okay people
[02:24] aren't giving the full truth or at least they're giving maybe a partial truth is probably better i mean they
[02:28] are saying "Hey yeah there's misinformation going on." Well it's it's more like partial information it turns out part of
[02:34] Claude Code's uh big plans is they they actually explicitly state in their toos this is only use in our
[02:41] products and so has this always been known yes apparently this have always been known effectively what a bunch of
[02:47] these tools do is that they use your OOTH token and they forge requests with specific headers and body it's
[02:53] very fragile like if if you've ever done this before uh have you ever had to treat like a blackbox
[02:58] service and you have to kind of guess how it needs to behave and then you get it up and
[03:02] running and then they make a change and it just just destroys your service until you come back up with
[03:07] the new change that they've made it's always very fragile super frustrating but this is how all the tools work
[03:12] and this toos thing it's been around since all the way back when Claude Code released in early 2025 they
[03:19] have always strongly discouraged using their APIs this way they put real effort into preventing it so in other words
[03:25] this problem that everybody's very angry about was actually just really a ticking time bomb underneath because Anthropic didn't enforce
[03:32] it they allowed it to continue to fester for a long time and a bunch of people switching over don't
[03:38] worry we're about to like literally we're about to get the tin foil out we're just we're not there yet
[03:43] i I want to make sure you guys really understand what's happening before I go off and yap project lastly
[03:48] apparently the person running Claude Code has came out and said this on Twitter which said this yesterday we tightened
[03:54] our safeguards against spoofing the Claude Code harness after accounts were banned for triggering abuse filters from thirdparty harnesses using
[04:00] cloud subscriptions third party harnesses using claw subscriptions create problems for users and are prohibited by our terms of service
[04:07] they generate unusual traffic patterns without any of the usual telemetry that cla code harnesses provide making it really hard
[04:13] for us to help debug when they have questions about rate limit usage or account bands and they don't have
[04:18] any other avenue for the support in other words it's just that these these abusive third-party platforms are just impossible
[04:25] to debug and any problem is perceived to be an anthropic problem not the tools problem and so that's what
[04:31] they're really saying they're they're really just saying "Hey for your best interest and for our ability to debug the
[04:37] only possible way forward is for us to make sure that we're always uh you know enforcing our toos no
[04:44] matter what." All right so that's kind of like the what has happened all right everybody we are now on
[04:49] the same page now the real question is why did this happen and why now like the Open Code has
[04:56] been using Anthropic for a long time cursor has a lot of these tools apparently like cloud something or another
[05:02] that's some other service is also using it like this has been around for months upon months upon months so
[05:08] why enforce it now especially at the height of clawed code glazing the first thing people kind of talk about
[05:16] which honestly I think is is is the weakest and probably the most incorrect of them all is the cost
[05:23] right so remember there's three potential plans there is going to be a pro plan and then you have the
[05:30] 5x plan and then you have the 20x plan this one's approximately $20 a month this one's 100 I believe
[05:37] and this one is 200 and so often what you see people kind of citing is that okay people don't
[05:43] really make usage of the uh pro plan except for maybe just a little bit actually cost more and then
[05:49] the of the 5x maybe half the people cost more than the actual thing and then for the 20x the
[05:55] large majority of them end up costing a lot more and to what extent they cost I don't know so
[06:00] the general calculus everyone runs on the math to like oh this is why they're doing it goes something along
[06:06] the lines of this right the integral of p over whatever its bounds is I'm not going to write its
[06:09] bounds uh plus of course the integral of the 5x plan plus the integral of the what's it called of
[06:15] the 20x plan is going to be like minus the integral let's just call whatever this line is I'm just
[06:20] going to call it uh g of x because I have no idea what the hell it is let's just
[06:24] call it g of x this thing has to be greater than zero and that's why they're doing it right
[06:28] the area underneath this curve is bigger than the area underneath these little price point stepladder curves right like that's
[06:37] what everybody's saying everyone's saying "Okay this is the real cost." That's that honestly I don't think this is the
[06:42] problem i mean yes I think money is the problem but I don't think this particular thing is the motivating
[06:48] factor or why we're seeing it now so to kind of put us in the right direction I believe that
[06:53] DAX actually has a really good like at least directionally correct tweet which is okay it's their business to have
[07:00] the right to enforce their terms however they like which is true like they already said from the beginning they
[07:04] don't want anyone bug cloud code using their subscriptions so it technically is their right to be able to do
[07:09] this they're not uh obligated to give anybody access to their services in any other way than they have set
[07:14] forth in their terms of service and if you've paid for it and you are now upset about it you
[07:18] don't have to continue to pay just stop paying so Dax's projection is that models aren't sticky enough yes Opus
[07:25] is good but so is Jippy 52 there's things that Jippy 52 can do better and there's things that Opus
[07:30] does better so it's not like the models are actually that sticky what they really want is that they want
[07:35] their entire tooling their entire stack to be what you use when you use Claude you use Claude code this
[07:43] way they own everything they show that they have more value effectively and I think this is a big thing
[07:49] especially when it comes to Open Code because you may not realize this but Open Code has been growing wildly
[07:54] they're about to hit 1 million monthly active users on their open-source project which means before it was just a
[08:01] toy project but now that it's just shooting up so wild and the reason by the way it's shooting up
[08:06] so wild if you have not used cloud code like I'm not trying to be mean Claude but I feel
[08:11] like I kind of have to be mean because let's can we all just agree Anthropic is the number one
[08:16] fear-mongering hey software engineering is going to end company of them all and Claude Code the product is just significantly
[08:25] far behind open code they've been having screen flickering just like it is like a dance club in your 2e
[08:33] editor that is honestly just like I'm going to get epilepsy from even looking at it they've had this for
[08:38] months now they tweeted about how they fixed 85% of it which is an absurd fix that's not a fix
[08:46] you don't know what the hell's going on if you can only fix 85% of it and second how did
[08:50] you even come up with that number and third one day later they had to roll back that change because
[08:56] other bugs were cropping up what it shows to me is that the company in which is telling you that
[09:00] software engineering is over can't even run their own like their own software they're not making the changes that are
[09:06] needed to be competitive and they're losing out to a bald man and a vegan from the Ozarks it's just
[09:12] diabolical these two yeah by the way you never you everybody knows you don't start a land war in Asia
[09:18] and you never go uh headtohead when open source is on the line with the vegan okay everybody knows that
[09:24] and by the way even with cloud code besides for the flickering uh when you type in Ultraink it's like
[09:28] this rainbow i had I had it more than once shift off and have like the antsy escape sequences just
[09:33] being printed in plain old regular text i mean just just egregious bug after egregious bug i couldn't expand co
[09:40] code with control O while in a menu to accept the code changes so it's like okay accept these code
[09:45] changes yes or no well if you want to see the code expand it well you can't leave the menu
[09:49] you're just like oh my gosh please what are you doing this Claude stop it stop it Claude just let
[09:53] me Oh I'm going to The tool is not good okay I'm first off an impressive software project and they've
[10:01] done good so far but it is not that usable comparatively to Open Code open Code is a beauty okay
[10:06] it's absolute beauty gives you all the information you know right up front you It's actually welldesigned it's by developers
[10:12] who like to code for developers who like to code and it's obvious so to me when I see this
[10:17] graph and people talking about this
[10:22] I don't think so i don't think that's it at all all right people we're going to need to do
[10:25] something i'm going to need the tinfoil hat up here for a second okay
[10:35] all right so this is what I think the real problem is that Anthropic is actually having okay I don't
[10:42] think it's just simply that previous graph what I think it is it is partially that previous graph right here
[10:47] but I think there's a lot of lies in that previous graph okay I think the amount that they're subsidizing
[10:54] uh the Pro the 5X and the 20X is much more than this graph leads you to believe i think
[10:59] the cost that they actually have to run everything is significantly higher first off you got to remember they have
[11:04] to do these huge amount of training runs that involve buying and being able to utilize a whole bunch of
[11:10] hardware and energy which is just going to be a gigantic number then you have the whole lifetime problem of
[11:16] the model how I mean who here's out there still using 35 when you got 374 and 45 on the
[11:22] table right now you also have Jippidity 5 Jippidity 51 Jippidity 52 you have all these other options that are
[11:29] better than 35 at 35 costed a huge amount of money and so the lifetime like operation of these models
[11:38] especially right now in such great change is rather low but the cost to actually run it is rather high
[11:43] plus you have employees which are extremely expensive it's stock grants that some of these higher paid jobs are just
[11:50] getting paid outrageous amounts of money plus you also have to have all the infrastructure and all that crap being
[11:56] set up to be able to run all the stuff that involves all the continual running of energy replacing GPUs
[12:02] and all that and then on top of it you got things like Nvidia just dropping brand new AI GPUs
[12:08] called Reuben that apparently is going to deliver 10x in reduction in inference token costs and 4x reduction in number
[12:14] of GPUs to train models that means MO models okay when you want more models you got to get the
[12:22] new chip and so this is like this constant rat race of trying to stay ahead of all the competitors
[12:26] like Chat Jippidity Google XAI i mean let's just I mean I know XAI really is only good at putting
[12:33] people in bikinis when they don't want to be put in bikinis but one day you never know okay you
[12:39] just never know so there's a real subsidation like subsidization problem going on here these tokens aren't just subs you
[12:46] know subsidized by like just the pro users versus the 20x users they're not subsidized by like 80% i would
[12:52] not be surprised to find out that these things are like 98% being subsidized right now meaning the true cost
[12:59] of the max plan currently is 50x more than they're actually saying because they're still trying to recuperate all the
[13:08] other things beforehand and then to remain competitive in the future there is a continual non-stop march into every single
[13:15] latest piece of hardware and everything that they must put in there ram RAM has already been purchased for all
[13:21] of 2026 so what they have is what they get and it's astronomically expensive with Samsung being like "Yeah we're
[13:28] going to just we're going to just 4x our price you going to pay for it?" And they're like "Yes
[13:31] absolutely please yes sir uh how when would you like me to bend over and how often?" Right like they're
[13:36] just absolutely at the whims of everybody and so if they can make a stack that's so competitive and then
[13:44] force people into this highly subsidized plan that can only be used on their stack their stack becomes the sticking
[13:50] point right because you can't use the cheap effective access to unlimited tokens and then on top of that you
[13:57] don't have access to other models when you don't want to use them right that's what that's why open code's
[14:02] so dangerous it isn't because you can use your Mac subscription it's because when I go "Huh let me try
[14:07] Gypy 2." Oh wow jippy 52 did really good right there maybe I don't want Opus all of a sudden
[14:14] yikes anyway so there you go that's my thoughts on the whole thing i know maybe I'm a little bit
[14:19] more of a fringe conspiracy theorist when it comes to this stuff but I think that I I I personally
[14:24] see trouble in the water okay i think that that's why they're doing it because why would you torpedo the
[14:30] single highest amount of developer gratitude and non-stop Twitter glazing it's so over we're never coming back software engineering opus
[14:40] is right i mean what you've seen videos on saying Daario was correct that 90% of code is going to
[14:46] be written in 3 to 6 months i mean it's just feverpitched we're talking about absolute feverpitched zealatry going out
[14:53] there on Twitter and then they just take they literally just take old Yeller out and they bam it is
[15:01] just insane so there you go that's it that's all I have to say hey I'm going to try something
[15:06] a little unusual you want to press like you want to make a comment tell me where you think I'm
[15:09] wrong tell me where you think I'm right i never usually invite these kind of things cuz honestly I think
[15:12] it's kind of I think it's kind of weird to do that yeah I know i did push for subscribers
[15:16] for a little bit to get over a million by the way thank you for the million i appreciate that
[15:19] anyways thanks for watching the name is I don't trust Daario i don't know if you know this but you
[15:25] may not know this but Daario guess what he said he thinks that open- source models are a danger he's
[15:31] always pushing for regulation he does not like open source he DMCAD a bunch of people when it came to
[15:38] them accidentally leaking their code and people deoffuscating it he does not like open source and Anthropic doesn't like open
[15:45] source and they want to own everything and they think that AI is too dangerous for anybody but them to
[15:49] run it and they ultimately just want control over you and your life they want to leave you helpless and
[15:54] incapable that is why 90% of all software is going to be written 100% of all software is going to
[15:59] be written because they don't want anyone to actually be learning and independent they want everybody to suckle from the
[16:04] teeth of Daario and that is that and that is what I actually believe i think that Daario is one
[16:09] of the most dangerous man on all of the AI landscape and that I don't think he has your best
[16:14] interest at heart a gen i know it's not easy to find developers to work with trust me I hired
[16:22] TJ so how do you find quality people to work with without spending all of your time on LinkedIn well
